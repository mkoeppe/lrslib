	Ver 1.0  parallel version (plrs)

	Author: Gary Roumanis

	I have adapted the synchronous lrslib library (v.4.3.) to take advantage
	of multiple processors/cores. My goal was to keep the program portable
	and stable. Thus, I took advantage of the free BOOST (http://www.boost.org/)
	library. Moreover, to limit the introduction of bugs I have made a concious
	effort to keep the underlying lrslib code untouched.
